Release notes for Luola 1.3.1
------------------------------

Luola 1.3.1 introduces yet more changes to the level file format.
This time however, backwards compatability is maintained. The following
changes were made to level configuration file format:

[end*] markers are no longer needed.
[icon] block was removed
thumbnail keyword was added to [main] block.

Levels no longer have icons, but they can (and should) have a thumbnail.
The thumbnail must be 120 pixels high.

Compact level files no longer use a binary configuration block, but instead
read the options from an embedded ASCII configuration file.
All levels offered on Luola homepage will work in both Luola 1.3.0 and 1.3.1.
Compact level files can now also contain multiple levels.

Datafiles have been relocated.
All image files are now packed in gfx.ldat, and all sounds are now in sfx.ldat
The data directory now only contains the levels/ subdirectory.

The compact level file creation utility mkecompact was removed. It is no not
needed anymore, as Luola no longer uses the binary configuration file format.
From now on, use the ldat utility to create compact level files.
Example .pack file for ldat tool:

ldat: mylevel.compact.lev
0	ARTWORK		mylevel.png
0	COLLISION	mylevelc.png
0	CONFIG		mylevel.lev
0	THUMBNAIL	mylevel.thumb.png
