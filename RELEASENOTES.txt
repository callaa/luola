Release notes for Luola 1.3.0
------------------------------

Luola 1.3.0 breaks backwards compatability with old compact level
files.
Specifically the following things have changed in levels:
 * modified option was removed
 * smooth_scaling option was removed
 * scalex and scaley were replaced with aspect and zoom

Level scaling is now done using the 'aspect' and 'zoom' options.
They accept floating point numbers as parameters.
Level size is is calculated in the following manner:
	width = width*aspect*zoom
	height = height*zoom
