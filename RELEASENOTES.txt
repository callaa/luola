Release notes for Luola 1.3.2
------------------------------

Luola 1.3.2 introduces a new unified physics engine. Most of the game
code (ships, weapons, critters, etc.) was rewritten.

Luola 1.3.2 is still a very much work in progress. Rewriting the game code
introduced many regressions in gameplay. Most notably, the pilot's ninjarope is
currently practically unusable.

Regressions to sort out:

Object-object collisions don't work properly yet. Ship collisions are disabled
until they are fixed. Also, acid and napalm currently don't stick to ships.

Pilot's rope is now spring system based. The system is currently highly
unstable and needs more work.

Some sound effects are missing. This just means adding more playwave() and
playwave_3d() calls. Also, some weapons could use a sound effect of their own,
rather than the generic one.
