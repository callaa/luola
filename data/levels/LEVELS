Since luola version 0.9.9 , levels are no longer distributed with the main
source package. This is simply to save download time, as it is rather pointless
to download the same levels over and over again when updating.
Please go to the luola homepage
http://www.luolamies.org/software/luola/
and download a level pack.

To install the levels, first install luola with 'make install' and then unpack
the level pack into the systemwide levels directory. By default it is
/usr/local/share/luola/levels
If you do not have write access, you can also install the levels locally for the
current user by unpacking them to ~/.luola/levels .
